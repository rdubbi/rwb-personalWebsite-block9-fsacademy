        My name is Roy Badell, but you probably already knew that since you
        found my Personal Website. I am a part-time Web Developer Student, a
        part time Vacant Land Investor, and a part time Military Intelligence
        NCO for the D.C. Army National Guard. I am full time dreaming of
        becoming a digital nomad and traveling the world (wifi permitting). It
        should come as no surprise that my favorite colors are orange, blue, and
        green, in that order. The purpose of this website is to practice what I
        have learned so far.
